## Bases
Let’s start by defining a what it is, production planning is the process in which is decided how a product or service will be manufactured before the process begins.

But why it important? Because it creates an efficient process for production and organizational needs, it also helps with potential problems that may occur during production

Knowing this a production plan is the document that describes how production processes will be executed. It describes the human resources and production schedule that will be followed.
